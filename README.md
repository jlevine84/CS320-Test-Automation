## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Testing! It is very easy write some code that meets specific requirements but may not be truely functional. I try to look at it through a lens of, "What can I do to break this." I've learned over the years that users WILL find ways to break your code or changes you made can be impacted in other portions of your software. While it is not possible to check for everything wrong, you can atleast do your due diligence and test your code thoroughly.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Requirements are the framework of why the program is being run and without them, we are just code-doodling. I think it is always a good idea to try and understand the "why" so as to give the programmer context to the user stories. This helps me code better since it can lead to ways of validating things like basic I/Os to expanding upon an idea.

## How do I approach designing software?
I always like to have a list of requirements that I can use as a guide. I then branch out and determine the structure based on the requirements and create a pseudocode framework.
